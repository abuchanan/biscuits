allow plugins to return a promise?

I don't like browserify. It doesn't need to walk the AST, because pretty
much every file is going to be included anyway. What I need is a simple
name resolver that can be run client-side. Walking the AST create lots
of complexity and doesn't allow for something like requiring a module
dynamically. It also makes the build/test cycle slower and more complex.


Probably will end up needing some way to find an object by name/ID
