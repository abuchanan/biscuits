big things
combat
--------------------------------------------------------------
weapons
-- spells
-- 
-- remote weapons e.g. detonate bomb
-- timed weapons e.g. time bomb
-- long distance weapons e.g. bow and arrow

enemies
- difficulty level
- figuring out which enemies are in the current view

reaction to being hit: enemy might freeze, or become agitated, or...

combat calculation
- weapons
- level
- enemy level
- difficulty level

damage
- player health

what happens when you die? i.e. health runs out?


AI
--------------------------------------------------------------
-- movement



store
--------------------------------------------------------------



state and save
--------------------------------------------------------------
-- character
--- name
--- items
--- health
map state
- e.g. door X has been unlocked
- map object Y has been picked up, or moved
- story state

how to load map and object state? e.g. coins are defined in the map file,
  but the player picks some of them up and then saves the game. when the
  map is next loaded, how do you check whether to include a coin or not?



story/conversation
--------------------------------------------------------------
comic book style?

story themes:
- every place has secrets
- unlock the secrets of the book
-- what does the book represent?

how does the story end?



other
=============================================================

circular player physics body

Load on demand:
- worlds on demand
-- load Tiled json, get load points, but don't bother with sprite slicing
   and world creation
- chunks of large worlds on demand?


animate view shift?

animation when switching world (e.g. go in door, current scene fades out)


status layer

walk through long grass, player sprite changes to match

sprites that cover multiple tiles
- should work, just need proof 

planes, trains, automobiles, submarines, etc


world map
inventory
settings

bridge: player on top of tile going one way, beneath tile going another




dev stuff:
- break into smaller files
- angular?
- unit test framework
- grunt?
- bower install list


is pixi loading tilesets sychronously?


things to define in Tiled and other ideas for objects:
- animated tiles (squirrel)
- monsters
- moveable objects
- equippable items
- chests
- locked doors
