Load on demand:
- worlds on demand
-- load Tiled json, get load points, but don't bother with sprite slicing
   and world creation
- chunks of large worlds on demand?

conversation windows

store

remote weapons
- e.g. detonate bomb
- time bomb

long distance weapons
- e.g. bow and arrow

game state

character
- name
- items
- health

map state
- e.g. door X has been unlocked
- story state


enemies
- difficulty level
- figuring out which enemies are in the current view


combat calculation
- weapons
- level
- enemy level
- difficulty level

damage

status layer

saving

walk through long grass, player sprite changes to match

AI
- AI might need some concept of "tick" so that every frame/cycle/tick/whatever
  it can decide the action to take based on world state

sprites that cover multiple tiles
- should work, just need proof 


max movement speed
- base movement time on frame rate?
- switch from tile coordinate movement?


planes, trains, automobiles, submarines, etc


stage renderer, i.e. be able to switch master renderer
- door that leads to store doesn't match viewpointloader

world map
inventory
settings

bridge: player on top of tile going one way, beneath tile going another


dev stuff:
- break into smaller files
- angular?
- unit test framework
- grunt?
- bower install list

renderers
- player
-- possibly animate in between tiles
- monsters
-- renderer for each monster?

s/renderer/layer/


possibly ditch tile coordinate system and use x/y coordinates
- will affect collision detection but should be simple fix
- will affect movement, but could be improvement

animation when switching world (e.g. go in door, current scene fades out)

things to define in Tiled and other ideas for objects:
- animated tiles (squirrel)
- monsters
- moveable objects
- equippable items
- chests
- locked doors

share tilesets among multiple worlds

"do action" buttons: talk to someone, attack, use magic, whatever

map load validation
