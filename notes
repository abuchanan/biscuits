Load on demand:
- worlds on demand
-- load Tiled json, get load points, but don't bother with sprite slicing
   and world creation
- chunks of large worlds on demand?

conversation windows

store

remote weapons
- e.g. detonate bomb
- time bomb

long distance weapons
- e.g. bow and arrow

game state

character
- name
- items
- health

map state
- e.g. door X has been unlocked
- map object Y has been picked up, or moved
- story state


enemies
- difficulty level
- figuring out which enemies are in the current view

animate view shift?

animation when switching world (e.g. go in door, current scene fades out)

combat calculation
- weapons
- level
- enemy level
- difficulty level

damage

status layer

saving

walk through long grass, player sprite changes to match

AI
- AI might need some concept of "tick" so that every frame/cycle/tick/whatever
  it can decide the action to take based on world state

sprites that cover multiple tiles
- should work, just need proof 

planes, trains, automobiles, submarines, etc

stage renderer, i.e. be able to switch master renderer
- door that leads to store doesn't match viewpointloader

world map
inventory
settings

bridge: player on top of tile going one way, beneath tile going another


how to load map and object state? e.g. coins are defined in the map file,
  but the player picks some of them up and then saves the game. when the
  map is next loaded, how do you check whether to include a coin or not?


dev stuff:
- break into smaller files
- angular?
- unit test framework
- grunt?
- bower install list

renderers
- player
- monsters
-- renderer for each monster?


things to define in Tiled and other ideas for objects:
- animated tiles (squirrel)
- monsters
- moveable objects
- equippable items
- chests
- locked doors

"do action" buttons: talk to someone, attack, use magic, whatever
