I have some semi-scattered thoughts I'd like to add to the discussion.

Re: https://github.com/angular/di.js/issues/22#issuecomment-36773343
While I'm turned off by the boilerplate, this approach is clear and explicit, two things I like more than brevity. 

Consider that you'd have to recreate this if you extended MyClass to MySubclass. I thought a static create() method might be nice:

```javascript
class MyClass {
    static create() {
        var deps = arguments;
        var cls = this;
        return function() {
            Array.prototype.unshift.apply(arguments, deps);
            return Function.prototype.bind.apply(cls, arguments);
        }
    }
}
```
It's possibly a minor issue, but maybe someone will find it interesting.

You could allow non-string tokens using a Map, no?
