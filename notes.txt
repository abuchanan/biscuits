TODO

- I made map loading super slow with the pass stuff....F

- player action input: getting pretty solid, but still needs a tweak: up takes precedence
                       over left, but really what you want is the last pressed direction
                       has precedence. obvious when passing through a door


- warning on duplicate object ID

- start menu
- comic screen

- pathfinding
- loadpoints preprocessing

- persist scene state past cache (e.g. save on quit, save when region removed from cache)

- inventory
- secondary action/attack
- attack dynamics (hit power, block chance, etc)
- projectile attack

- touch screen path planning for player movement
- editor
- smooth maps
- use KV language for widgets?

- what if you wanted to reference an object in a different region?
  currently, that would conflict with region loading/unloading semantics
  - could implement system that could load any object by ID (and cache it)
    regardless of region. regions would just be a list of IDs to load.


- tree data structure for map definition. e.g. allows

  region
     obj 1
     obj 2
        obj 3

  could be very useful, especially for simplifying region code


- python ABCs are interesting. there might be a place for them in biscuits
